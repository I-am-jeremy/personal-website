## Welcome to My WebPage

My name is Jeremy Rebenstock and I am currently an undergraduate student at Michigan State University Majoring in Physics and Mathematics with an expected garduation of May 2023. I do research on Electron capture reactions of Thermally excited Neculei at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams under the guidance of Remco Zegers.

I will be working as a Undergarduate learning assistant for an introductory physics mechanics course this year.
