## Welcome to My WebPage

My name is Jeremy Rebenstock and I am currently an undergraduate student at Michigan State University Majoring in Physics and Mathematics with an expected garduation of May 2023. I do research on Electron capture reactions of Thermally excited Neculei at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams under the guidance of Remco Zegers.  (explain more)

I will be working as a Undergarduate learning assistant for an introductory physics mechanics course this year. I am a member of MSU's elected board for the Society of Physics Students and I am working on creating a club (Research And Idea Sharing Enterprise (RAISE) for MSU based on sharing research with the community in an accesible form. 

### Markdown
For fun I enjoy hiking, camping and all sorts of other outdoor activities. (see pictures (add pictures)). I also enjoy playing chess, writting and learning in general.
